### Code style

We're trying our best to make our clean and easy to read. We know that this isn't a easy task, also no one is perfect.

This CLI is separated by separate parts called **modules** and it's intentional to make them independent from each other.

If you really need something from any of the existing modules, consider moving it to `/shared` directory and make it more generic.

Each separate piece of code should be put inside its separate function, which is included in separate file with the same name.

It's pretty important to use comments, such as JSDoc or just simple explanations what is going on.

Please follow ESLint rules.

### Commits

Make sure you follow our commit naming guidelines ([convential commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)).

Your commit message should look like this:

```
<type>: <description>
```

Types that can be used: `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`

### When you're done

Make sure that your code is formatted correctly and follows project guidelines:

```bash
pnpm format:check
```

Test all features impacted by your change, and do a manual test of all features you've provided. Make sure you didn't break anything ðŸ˜‰.

If your changes the way how CLI works and it should be included in changelog, please run `changeset` command and answer some serious questions about your code.

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

then add changes to git

```bash
git add ./changeset/*.md && git commit -m "chore: add changeset"
```

If everything works, is formatted and linted correctly - it's time to push your changes to the fork and create new pull request.
