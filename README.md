# WP-Theme CLI

## Goal

Starting new WP projects can be time consuming. I've decided to create this CLI to automate some of tasks.  
For now, I'm focusing on files operations, such as removing unnecessary files or creating new ones.

## Requirements

- Node >= 14.17.0

## Available options

Check all commands available using help command

### Generate modules

In my company, the **modules** are simply a flexible field rows, and we are using separate file for each module.  
You can use this command to generate files for flexible field.
